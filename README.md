 Traffic accidents that cause a lot of damages are occurring in Colorado (how many?). The most effective solution to these types of accidents can be to predict future accidents in advance, giving drivers chances to avoid the dangers or reduce the damage by responding quickly. 
 
 Predicting accidents on the road can be achieved using classification analysis, a data mining procedure requiring enough data to build a learning model. However, building such a predicting system involves several problems. It requires many hardware resources to collect and analyze traffic data for predicting traffic accidents since the data are extremely large.

 Our Team will choose from the traffic data currently available that will be used for predicting accidents.
