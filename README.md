 Traffic accidents that cause a lot of damages are occurring in Colorado (how many?). The most effective solution to these types of accidents can be to predict future accidents in advance, giving drivers chances to avoid the dangers or reduce the damage by responding quickly. 
 
 Predicting accidents on the road can be achieved using classification analysis, a data mining procedure requiring enough data to build a learning model. However, building such a predicting system involves several problems. It requires many hardware resources to collect and analyze traffic data for predicting traffic accidents since the data are extremely large.

 Our Team will choose from the traffic data currently available that will be used for predicting accidents.


## Final Project Overview
For the Final Project, you will work with your group to collaboratively solve or analyze a problem using advanced ML methodologies. In your solution, you will incorporate transformer models, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and other tools acquired throughout the course, in addition to at least one new technology that we haven’t covered together.

Here are the specific requirements:

Identify a problem worth solving or analyzing.
Find a dataset or datasets that are sufficiently large enough to effectively train a ML model or neural network with a high degree of accuracy to ensure that your results are reliable.
Evaluate the trained model(s) using testing data. Include any calculations, metrics, or visualizations needed to evaluate the performance.
You must use at least two of the following:
scikit-learn
Keras
TensorFlow
Hugging Face
spaCy or Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
LangChain
OpenAI
You must use one additional library or technology NOT covered in class, such as:
Valence Aware Dictionary for Sentiment Reasoning (VADER)
Whisper (OpenAI’s automatic speech recognition system)
DALL·E (OpenAI’s text-to-image model)
Other OpenAI capabilities, including:
Text-to-speech
GPT-4 with vision (GPT-4V)
PyTorch
For this project, you can focus your efforts within a specific industry, as detailed in the following examples.

Finance
Build a customer service chatbot for a financial firm that analyzes a user’s request and makes customized recommendations in one or more languages.

Develop a deep learning model that forecasts and predicts stock prices for at least three publicly traded companies.

Use NLP, transformers, or OpenAI to summarize key takeaways from a company’s earnings call.

Healthcare
Build a transformer model that captions medical images in one or more languages.

Develop a deep learning model to distinguish between malignant and benign moles.

Use NLP to de-identify medical data such as name, birthdate, and ID number.

Custom
We’ve only specified healthcare and finance, but any industry can benefit from applying NLP, transformers, or OpenAI technologies. Consider preparing a data deep dive or infrastructure review that shows ML in the context of what we’ve already learned.

Develop an integrated AI model that accurately detects and filters out spam messages.

Use NLP to analyze social media data or customer reviews to understand user sentiment about a product, service, or issue.

Develop a transformer model that translates between two or more languages of your choice.

Working with Your Group
When working on an online group project, it’s crucial to meet with your group and communicate regularly. Plan for significant collaboration time outside of class. The following tips can help you make the most of your time:

Decide how you’re going to communicate with your group members when you begin. Create a Slack channel, exchange phone numbers, and ensure that the group knows each group member’s available working hours.

Set up an agile project by using GitHub ProjectsLinks to an external site. so that your group can track tasks.

Create internal milestones to ensure that your group is on track. Set due dates for these milestones so that you have a timeline for completing the project. Some of these milestones might include:

Project ideation;

Data fetching;

Data exploration;

Data transformation;

Data analysis;

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Testing ML models;

Integrate AI tools into the project for deployment

Creating documentation; and

Creating the presentation.

Since this is a two-week project, make sure that you have completed at least half of your project by the end of the first week in order to stay on track.

Although you will divide the work among the group members, it’s essential to collaborate and communicate while working on different parts of the project. Be sure to check in with your teammates regularly and offer support.

Support and Resources
Your instructional team will provide support during classes and office hours. You will also have access to learning assistants and tutors to help you with topics as needed. Make sure to take advantage of these resources as you collaborate with your group on this project.
